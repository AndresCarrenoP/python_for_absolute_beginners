# use this symbol # followed by a single space for single line comments
# you can also use """ for multi-line comments as shown below, however use it sparingly, it's considered a bad practice

"""
a variable CANNOT have a number at the start of its name
numbers are ok as long as they are not in the first character
variable names cannot have spaces
don't use special characters in variable names
camelCase is ok for variable names
snake_case_variable is also ok for variable names - much more common than camelCase for python
